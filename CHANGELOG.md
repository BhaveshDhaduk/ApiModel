# Changelog

## 0.12.0

Breaking changes:

- Update to Realm 1.0.0 ðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆ

## 0.11.0

Breaking changes:

- Changed the interface for `Transform`. The `perform`-method now includes a second parameter:

```swift
func perform(value: AnyObject?, realm: Realm?) -> AnyObject?
```

This will be the Realm object that will be associated with any newly created objects. For example in `ModelTransform` or `ArrayTransform`.

Dependency upgrade:

- This release bumps Realm to version `0.98.4`, which should not break your app installs.
